## Installing the template in Xcode

To install the template you need to go to 
```
/Users/[user name]/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/
```

If the folder `Templates` doesnt exist you can simply create it. 

Next create a Folder that will be a representation of a group of templates in navigator. 

For example if you name it `Custom` It will display like: 

<img width="725" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 16 20 16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8c0a96-7387-4d78-abd4-372d0efa0ad4" />

Copy `MVVM-Delegates.xctemplate` to that folder.

And you're done! 

Happy templating :D
